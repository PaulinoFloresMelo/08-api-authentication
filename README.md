## Create a virtual enviroment
It's recommended to have a dedicated virtual environment for each Django project. One way to manage this is with venv, included in Python.

You choose the name of the virtual environment; in this case, we'll call it env.

Type the following at the command prompt; remember to navigate to where you want to create your project:

`py -m venv env`

## Istall requirements

To install the necessary dependencies run `pip install -r requirements.txt`


## Development server

Run `python manage.py runserver` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
